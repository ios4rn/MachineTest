I have given an assignment to design three screens. The first screen have two labels, two textfields and two buttons.The second screen having two labels, two textfields and two buttons.The Third screen have a tableview and a logout button, and the tableview contains one imageview and three labels. As a conclusion of my assignment I have done API call and displayed it in the  tableview. I have used some frame works such as Alamofire and Kingfisher to complete the API call.

I have tried my best to complete task. If you find any mistakes from my assignment, please do inform me. Because it will help me to improve as a beginner.
